# simcardems2

Simcardems2 is the next version of [Simula Cardiac Electro-Mechanics Solver (simcardems)](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/simcardems) and a part of the [SimCardioTest](https://www.simcardiotest.eu/wordpress/) project. The solver uses [pulse](https://github.com/finsberg/pulse) and [fenics-beat](https://github.com/finsberg/fenics-beat) to solve mechanics and electrophysiology, respectively. Both libraries are based on [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/).
